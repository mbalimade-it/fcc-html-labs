# Fun Survey Form

I created this form based on The Office humour. I love this show, so why not make a form that is fun and interactive...

# Objective

Practice working with the `label` element, the different `input` elements, the `required` attribute, and more.

# Notes

- I used different input types
- I learned to give appropriate attributes to `label`, `form`, and `input` elements.
- I learned the `select` element.
